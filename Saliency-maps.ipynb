Try to implement TracIn or any other metric of data influence.\n",

If you have access to an LLM, you can try it! Take a specific neuron in the model, and collect the activation for multiple examples. Provide these activations to the LLM, and prompt it to provide a human-understandable explanation. What is the result?"
